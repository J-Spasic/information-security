# Information Security

## Overview

Simple Cryptosystem projects for the ***Information Security*** course at ***Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Ni≈°***.

### Cryptosystem Projects

![Four-Square Cipher Cryptosystem](https://github.com/J-Spasic/information-security/tree/main/FourSquareCipherCryptosystem)
- Windows Forms application with the ability to encrypt Text Documents in the watched folder or manually encrypt and decrypt them using *Four-Square Cipher*.

![Cryptosystem With FSW](https://github.com/J-Spasic/information-security/tree/main/CryptosystemWithFSW)
- Windows Forms application with the ability to encrypt Text Documents in the watched folder or manually encrypt and store them as DAT Files. It is also possible to choose which file you want to decrypt back into a Text Document.
- Available cryptographic algorithms are: *Four-Square Cipher*, *DES* and *DES with CFB mode*.
- **NOTE:** At the beginning of the encrypted file based on *DES* algorithms, a hash is stored which is computed based on *SHA1* hash function.
