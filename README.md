# information-security
Small cryptosystems created for the Information Security course, developed using .NET 5.

[FourSquareCipherCryptosystem](https://github.com/J-Spasic/information-protection/tree/main/FourSquareCipherCryptosystem)
> Windows Forms application with the ability to encrypt Text Documents in the watched folder or manually encrypt and decrypt them using Four-Square Cipher.

[CryptosystemWithFSW](https://github.com/J-Spasic/information-protection/tree/main/CryptosystemWithFSW)
> Windows Forms application with the ability to encrypt Text Documents in the watched folder or manually encrypt and store them as DAT Files. It's also possible to choose which file you want to decrypt back into a Text Document.
>
> Available cryptographic algorithms are: Four-Square Cipher, DES and DES with CFB mode.
>
> NOTE: At the beginning of the encrypted file based on DES algorithms, a hash is stored which is computed based on SHA1 hash function.
