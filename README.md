# Information Security

## Overview

Cryptosystem projects created for the ***Information Security*** course at ***Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of NiÅ¡***.

Both are ***Windows*** applications based on a `FileSystemWatcher` class from ***.NET***.

### Four-Square Cipher Cryptosystem

**Four-Square Cipher Cryptosystem** has the ability to encrypt Text Documents in the watched folder or manually encrypt and decrypt them using *Four-Square Cipher*.

### Cryptosystem with FSW

**Cryptosystem with FSW** has the ability to encrypt Text Documents in the watched folder or manually encrypt and store them as DAT Files. It is also possible to choose which file you want to decrypt back into a Text Document.

Available cryptographic algorithms are: *Four-Square Cipher*, *DES* and *DES with CFB mode*.

> ðŸ”´ NOTE: At the beginning of the encrypted file based on DES algorithms, a hash is stored which is computed based on SHA1 hash function.

## Technologies

**Four-Square Cipher Cryptosystem** and **Cryptosystem with FSW** are ***Windows Forms*** applications based on ***.NET 5***.
